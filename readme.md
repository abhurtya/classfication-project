# Date Fruit Classification

This project aims to classify date fruits by using machine learning techniques. The date fruits used in the study include: Barhee, Deglet Nour, Sukkary, Rotab Mozafati, Ruthana, Safawi, and Sagai.

The dataset used in this project includes 898 preprocessed date fruits, for which 34 features were extracted from images of each fruit. These features were divided into 3 main categories: morphological, shape, and color features.

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of various machine learning techniques and determine the best one in terms of accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other metrics.

## Getting Started

To run the code and replicate our results, you will need to install the dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
You also need to provide the dataset on your local machine, which you can download.

## Running the code

The code can be executed by running the main.rmd file. Before running the R Markdown (Rmd) file, you might need to have the following, if not installed already:

- R: R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can download R from the official website (https://cran.r-project.org/) for your operating system.

- RStudio: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing, running, and debugging R code. You can download RStudio from the official website (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) for your operating system.

- Required R packages: The Rmd file may require certain R packages to be installed in order to run properly. These packages will typically be listed at the top of the Rmd file, and can be installed using the install.packages() function in R.

If you want to render the file in other formats, you will need some other dependencies. The file may also require specific version of the packages. So, please check the file header and make sure the required package version and dependencies are installed in your machine.

Once you have all of these components installed and configured, you should be able to open the Rmd file in RStudio and knit/run the file, which will execute the code and generate the output.
